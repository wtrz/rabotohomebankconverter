Personal finances | Python script | Goal to convert Rabobank 'Transactions.txt' into Homebank csv format

Import Rabobank into Homebank software


By default Rabobank's export file 'Transactions.txt' cannot be imported into Homebank personal finance software (http://homebank.free.fr/). This python script transcodes the Rabobank file for Homebank to accept. 

Prerequisites: 

1. Python 3 to be installed (https://www.python.org/downloads/)
2. Transactions.txt & Rabo_to_Homebank_converter.py to be placed in the same directory. 

Usage:

1. Python Rabo_to_Homebank_converter.py
2. Import the generated .csv file into Homebank.
